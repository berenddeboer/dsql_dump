# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

`dsql_dump` is a utility to dump an AWS DSQL database as SQL, similar to what `pg_dump` does. The project is built using TypeScript with Projen for project configuration and management.

## Development Commands

### Package Management
This project uses Bun as the package manager:
```bash
bun install
```

### Running the Application
```bash
bun run index.ts
```

### Build and Development
All development commands are managed through Projen:
- `npm run build` - Build the project
- `npm run compile` - Compile TypeScript
- `npm run watch` - Watch mode for development
- `npm run test` - Run Jest tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run eslint` - Run ESLint

### Project Management
- `npm run projen` - Regenerate project files from .projenrc.ts
- `npm run upgrade` - Upgrade dependencies

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts` - Main application entry point
- `test/` - Jest test files
- `.projenrc.ts` - Projen configuration (TypeScript project setup)
- `package.json` - Generated by Projen (do not edit manually)

## Architecture Notes

- Use Bun APIs where one exists
- We cannot use bun's postgresql driver as it does not support the COPY protocol

## Important Notes

- This project is managed by Projen - do not edit `package.json` directly. Instead, modify `.projenrc.ts` and run `npm run projen`
- Uses Bun as the runtime and package manager
- Jest is configured for testing with coverage reporting
- ESLint is configured for code quality
- The project targets publication to npm with public access
